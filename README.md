# Hey! I'm Lewis

I'm a **Mathematics of Computation** major at UCLA with interests in fitness, math, programming, fashion, and learning new languages (currently learning Korean). Lately, I’ve been creating projects using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while also diving deeper into Python.  

I’m excited to keep learning, collaborate with others, and grow as a developer.
