# Hey, I’m Lewis 👋  

I’m a **Mathematics of Computation** major at **UCLA** with interests in **fitness, math, programming, fashion, and language learning** (currently learning Korean 🇰🇷).

I’ve been building projects with **React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, while also diving deeper into **Python**.

I’m always excited to learn new things, collaborate on projects, and grow as a developer.
